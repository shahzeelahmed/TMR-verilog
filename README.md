# Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) in Verilog

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)** using **Verilog HDL**, with two primary components:

1. Master Slave communication using the **SPI protocol**
2. Fault tolerant logic design via **majority gate based TMR**

## Master-Slave Communication via SPI

**Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** is a full-duplex synchronous protocol often used in embedded systems for short distance communication.

### SPI Line Description

| Signal | Direction        | Description                                 |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| MISO   | Slave → Master   | Transfers data from slave to master         |
| MOSI   | Master → Slave   | Transfers data from master to slave         |
| SCLK   | Master → Slave   | Clock generated by master to sync data      |
| SS     | Master → Slave   | Active low signal to select slave devices   |

### SPI Role Definitions

| Role    | Responsibility                                                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Master  | Initiates and controls communication and provides clock and chip select      |
| Slave   | Responds to master’s commands and transmits or receives data accordingly     |

This implementation includes Verilog modules for both **master** and **slave**, handling bit-level data exchange over the SPI bus.

## Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)

**TMR** is a hardware redundancy strategy where logic is triplicated and a **majority voter** is used to determine the final output. It is commonly used in critical systems to mitigate faults due to single event upsets (SEU) , hardware errors, or environmental noise.

### Majority Voter Logic Table

| Input A | Input B | Input C | Voter Output |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
|    0    |    0    |    0    |      0       |
|    0    |    0    |    1    |      0       |
|    0    |    1    |    0    |      0       |
|    0    |    1    |    1    |      1       |
|    1    |    0    |    0    |      0       |
|    1    |    0    |    1    |      1       |
|    1    |    1    |    0    |      1       |
|    1    |    1    |    1    |      1       |

Only one module failure (bit-flip or logic error) will not affect the final output, ensuring continued correct operation.
